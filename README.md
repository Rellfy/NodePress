# NodePress
Lightweight, dynamic blog engine for Node.

NodePress is an API-styled blog engine for Node software and servers. It uses Mongo as its DB and Socketio/Express for server-client communication. NodePress was built to be a fast and light alternative for blog integrations with Node.

## How to

**1.** install it with `npm install nodepress`
**2.** add it to your server by using `var NodePress = require('nodepress'); var nodePress = new NodePress();`
**3.** take a look at the server and client files at the example directory for an easy setup and a living example after DB config.
